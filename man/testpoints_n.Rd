\title{testpoints_n - Random points in USA - average resident, facility, BG, block, or square mile
Get data.table of Random Points (lat lon) for Testing/ Benchmarking/ Demos, weighted in various ways.
The weighting can be specified so that each point reflects the average EPA-regulated
facility, blockgroup, block, place on the map, or US resident.}
\usage{
testpoints_n(
  n = 10,
  weighting = c("frs", "pop", "area", "bg", "block"),
  dt = TRUE,
  ST_needed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of points needed (sample size)}

\item{weighting}{word indicating how to weight the random points (some synonyms are allowed, in addition to those shown here):

Note the default is frs, but you may want to use pop even though it is slower.
\itemize{
\item pop or people = Average Person: random person among all US residents (block point of residence per 2020 Census)
\item frs or facility = Average Facility: random EPA-regulated facility from actives in Facility Registry Service (FRS)
\item bg = Average Blockgroup: random US Census block group (internal point like a centroid)
\item block = Average Block: random US Census block (internal point like a centroid)
\item area or place = Average Place: random point on a map (internal point of avg blockgroup weighted by its square meters size)
}}

\item{dt}{logical, whether to return a data.table (DEFAULT) instead of normal data.frame}

\item{ST_needed}{optional, can be a character vector of 2 letter State abbreviations to pick from only some States.}
}
\value{
data.frame or data.table with columns lat, lon in decimal degrees, and
any other columns that are in the table used (based on weighting)
}
