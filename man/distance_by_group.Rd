\title{distance_by_group - Avg distance of each demog group (of multiple groups)
Same as \code{\link[=plot_distance_mean_by_group]{plot_distance_mean_by_group()}} but no plot by default}
\usage{
distance_by_group(
  results_bybg_people,
  demogvarname = NULL,
  demoglabel = NULL,
  returnwhat = "table",
  graph = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_bybg_people}{data.table from doaggregate()$results_bybg_people}

\item{demogvarname}{vector of column names like "pctlowinc" etc.}

\item{demoglabel}{vector of labels like "Low Income Residents" etc.}

\item{returnwhat}{If returnwhat is "table", invisibly returns a
data.frame with group, ratio, avg_distance_for_group, avg_distance_for_nongroup.
If returnwhat is "plotfilename" then it returns the full path including filename of a .png in a tempdir
If returnwhat is "plot" then it returns the plot object as needed for table_xls_format() ?}

Shows distance to sites, for residents in each demographic group (vs everyone else)
