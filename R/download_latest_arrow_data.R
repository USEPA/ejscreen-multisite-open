#' Download latest versions of arrow datasets if user doesn't have them already
#'
#' Used when EJAM package is attached
#' @details
#'   Checks to see what is the latest version of datasets available according to a repository's latest release tag.
#'   Compares that to what version was last saved locally (as stored in the installed package's 
#'   ejamdata_version.txt file). 
#'   
#'   Relies on [piggyback::pb_releases()] to download data files from a specific release (version) of the package.
#' 
#' @param varnames use defaults, or vector of names like "bgej" or use "all" to get all available
#' @repository repository name such as "USEPA/ejamdata"
#' 
#' @export
