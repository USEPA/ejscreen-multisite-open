#' @description
#' EJAM provides a way to run hundreds or thousands of EJScreen-style reports all at once, very quickly.
#' It is also an R package, with functions and data for very fast analysis of areas defined by
#' proximity to points like regulated facilities, areas defined as shapefiles/polygons,
#' or areas specified as Census units (e.g., Counties).
#' 
#' @details  # **What is EJAM and How to do EJ Analysis with the EJAM R Package** ###################
#'
#' [EJAM package documentation](https://usepa.github.io/EJAM/index.html) provides
#' an overview of EJAM, a complete reference document on all functions, and
#' articles (vignettes) introducing key functions and how to use them.
#'
#' @details  # **Data Sources -- Demographic and Environmental Indicators**  ###################
#' 
#'   [EJScreen documentation](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/understanding-ejscreen-results) provides
#'   information about the sources, definitions, and vintage of the
#'   demographic and environmental data and indicators used by
#'   EJScreen/EJAM.
#'   
#'   Each year, EJScreen/EJAM are updated to use newer demographic and environmental data,
#'   and some indicators may be added, dropped, or revised during those updates. 
#'   For details on these updates and changes to datasets and indicators,
#'   please see [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) and in particular note the
#'   information about updates and changes here: 
#'   [EJScreen Change Log](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/ejscreen-change-log).
#'   Demographics are from the American Community Survey 5-year summary file data that are updated by
#'   the United States Census Bureau annually and then used in EJScreen/EJAM.
