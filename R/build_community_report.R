#' Generate EJAM Summary Report in HTML within shiny app
#' 
#' Creates a 2 page report on overall results or for one site, with demographic and environmental indicators, and EJ Indexes if needed.
#' 
#' @details For the same function for use in RStudio, 
#' see [ejam2report()] which relies on `build_community_report()`
#' 
#' This function gets called by 
#'  app_server,
#'  ejam2report(), and
#'  community_report_template.Rmd
#' 
#' @param output_df, single row of results table from doaggregate - either results_overall or one row of bysite
#' @param analysis_title, title to use in header of report
#' @param totalpop, total population included in location(s) analyzed
#' @param locationstr, description of the location(s) analyzed
#' @param include_ejindexes, whether to build tables for EJ and EJ supp. indexes
#' @param in_shiny, whether the function is being called in or outside of shiny - affects location of header
#' @param filename, path to file to save HTML content to; if null, returns as string (used in Shiny app)
#' 
#' @keywords internal
#' @export
