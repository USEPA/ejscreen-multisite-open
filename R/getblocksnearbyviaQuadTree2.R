#' Find nearby blocks using Quad Tree data structure for speed, NO PARALLEL PROCESSING
#'
#' @description Given a set of points and a specified radius (cutoff), 
#'   this function quickly finds all the US Census blocks near each point. 
#'   For each point, it uses the specified cutoff distance and finds the distance to 
#'   every block within the circle defined by the radius (cutoff). 
#'   Each block is defined by its Census-provided internal point, by latitude and longitude.
#'   
#'   Each point can be the location of a regulated facility or other type of site, and 
#'   the blocks are a high-resolution source of information about where
#'   residents live. 
#'   
#'   Finding which blocks have their internal points in a circle provides 
#'   a way to quickly estimate what fraction of a block group is 
#'   inside the circular buffer more accurately and more quickly than
#'   areal apportionment of block groups would provide. 
#'   
#' @details  Relies on blockquadtree, indexgridsize and quaddata  
#'   variables that need to be available in the global environment, as data
#'   from a loaded package. 
#' 
#' @param sitepoints data.table with columns siteid, lat, lon giving point locations of sites or facilities around which are circular buffers
#' @param cutoff miles radius, defining circular buffer around site point 
#' @param maxcutoff miles distance (max distance to check? if not even 1 block point is within cutoff)
#' @param uniqueonly logical WILL BE REMOVED AND DONE apart from THIS FUNCTION. default FALSE (may remove this param) Whether to retain only unique blocks (unique residents) to avoid double-counting (but we want to drop duplicates later, not in here)
#' @param avoidorphans logical
#' @param quadtree a quadtree object created from the SearchTree package example:
#'    SearchTrees::createTree(blockdata::quaddata, treeType = "quad", dataType = "point")
#'    Would take about 5 seconds to create this each time it is needed.
