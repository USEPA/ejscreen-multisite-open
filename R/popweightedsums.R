  # *** The rollup of all block group scores in buffer is done via block-population-weighted mean of raw %scores from relevant parts of blockgroups in buffer.
  # ESCREEN's existing buffering code as of 2021 has always just used popwtd mean of raw % scores, it looks like.***
  # Even for raw % scores that have original denominators other than pop:
  #   pctlowinc (actually % of those for whom poverty ratio was known),
  #   pctlths (actually % of those age 25up),
  #   pctlingiso (actually % of households or units?),
  #   pctpre1960 (actually % of households or units?).
  # Ideally a more exact method to find the overall %low income, etc., might be to sum the counts and then find the rolled up % as the ratio of counts,
  # using the correct denominator for each %, such as households, people over age 25, etc.
  # Would have to change this code to roll up to buffer using ratio of sums rather than popwtd mean.
  #  *** BUT ... EJSCREEN existing buffering as of 2021 has always just used popwtd mean of raw % scores, it looks like.  ***
  # and the answer is the same thing if the denominator is pop anyway,
  # or if the % in each blockgroup is interpreted and treated as the percent of people (not just hhlds, povknownratio, age25up, etc.),
  # or if those more correct denominators are roughly the same fraction of total pop for each of the blockgroups involved in the rollup.
  # The bottom line is we just can use popwtd mean of % values to do rollup for those % indicators.
