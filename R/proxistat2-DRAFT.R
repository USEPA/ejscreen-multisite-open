#' proxistat2 - Calculate a proximity score for every blockgroup - WORK IN PROGRESS
#' Indicator of proximity of each blockgroups to some set of facilities or sites.
#' @details  Proximity score is sum of (1/d) where each d is distance of a given site in km, 
#'   summed over all sites within 5km, as in EJScreen.
#'   
#'   getblocksnearbyviaQuadTree.R() and maybe doaggregate()?
#'   
#'    has a bit of code in it to do some of what this function does.
#'   
#' @param pts data.table of lat lon
#' @param countradius distance within in which nearby sites are counted to create proximity score.
#'   In miles, and default is 5km (8.04672 miles)
#'   which is the EJScreen zone for proximity scores based on counts.
#' @param maxradius max distance in miles to search for nearest single facility,
#'   if none found within countradius. EJScreen seems to use 1,000 km as the max to search,
#'   since the lowest scores for proximity scores of RMP, TSDF, or NPL are around 0.001, 
#'   meaning approx. 1/1000 km and km_per_mile = 1.609344
#'   so 1000 km is 1000 / 1.609344 = 621.3712 miles
#' @param quadtree must be called localtree, an index of block locations, 
#'   built during use of EJAM package. see [quaddata]
#' @return data.table with proximityscore, bgfips, lat, lon, etc.

  # excerpt from 2017 tech doc on using min dist to create proximity scores
  #  but the same idea applies if EJAM is
  #  calculating and reporting distance from each site to avg resident in each block and then bg) ---
  # 
  # Since we cannot easily find out how the
  # residents are actually distributed in those areas, we made two simplifying assumptions:
  # - residents are evenly distributed across the surface area of each block, and
  # - each block can be represented by a circle whose radius is
  
  # [Block area / Pi]^(1/2) 
  
  # We call this latter value the "Block Area Equivalent Radius."
  
  # Our investigations indicate that for any dij less than the Block Area Equivalent Radius, 0.9 times that
  # value is a reasonable representation of the average distance from the facility for all residents in the
  # block. We call this the dij corrected.
  # Our computational scheme determines the dij values as described above, tests for the comparison with
  # Block Area Equivalent Radius, and substitutes dij corrected values. We found that we needed to make
  # that correction for less than 1% of all facility/block combinations in an early testing dataset that used
  # 2005-2009 ACS data.

  # 1) if not done already via getblocksnearby(), get distances that are <= radius using get.distances()
  
  # but here we want to create a score for each US block then roll up to bg scores,
  # by for each block finding all nearby sites, rather than EJAM analysis of 
  # doing at each site finding all nearby blocks 
  # unless for efficiency the other way around.
  # EFFICIENCY QUESTION: 
  #  Obvious possible algorithm at least if running it for the entire FRS of all facilities, is to 
  #  STEP 1: loop through all 8 million US blocks, and for each block count all nearby facilities (sites),
  #   but vast majority of blocks will have zero sites nearby, so 
  #   STEP 2: for every block with zero sites nearby, expand search somehow until finding nearest 1 site. HOW?
  
  #  But for users needing proxistat for a few hundred or thousand site types (e.g. CAFOs)  
  #  for all 8 mill us blocks still,  
  # another approach to check is 
  # STEP 1: loop through just the 10k, 100k, or 1.5 million sites (is it faster than step 1 above?), 
  # and for each site find all nearby blocks, maybe 1k each, say. 
  #   then do STEP 2 as above.
  
  # THE VAST MAJORITY OF BLOCKS WILL HAVE ZERO WITHIN THE 5 KM RADIUS, SO NEAREST 1 IS BASIS FOR THEIR SCORE, BUT
  #   SOME WILL EVEN HAVE ZERO WITHIN THE MAX RADIUS TO CHECK
  # if none found within radius of 5km, this func does not yet create score based on single nearest
  
  #   obvious way, blocks as sites and sites as blocks?... but getblocksnearby is not written to enable that.
  
  # other way: like EJAM but then have to invert what is near what:
  
  sites2blocks <- getblocksnearby(sitepoints = pts, radius = countradius, maxradius = maxradius, avoidorphans = TRUE)
  
  
  # we will AGGREGATE BY blockid, not by site  , to create proxistat
  
  
  
  
  
  
  # 2) where d < min.dist, set d <- min.dist to adjust it upwards (ie use the max of min.dist and distance??)
  ######################################## #
  # ADJUST THE VERY SHORT DISTANCES ####
  
  # distance gets adjusted to be the minimum possible value,  0.9 * effective radius of block_radius_miles (see EJScreen Technical Documentation discussion of proximity analysis for rationale)
  #
  # use block_radius_miles here, to correct the distances that are small relative to a block size.
  # This adjusts distance the way EJScreen does for proximity scores - so distance reflects distance of sitepoint to avg resident in block
  # (rather than sitepoint's distance to the block internal point),
  # including e.g., where distance to block internal point is so small the site is inside the block.
  # This also avoids infinitely small or zero distances.
  # 2 ways considered to do join here - may be able to optimize.
  # a) try to do join that updates sites2blocks by reference - not sure it works this way, but goal was to make join faster:
  # sites2blocks[blockwts, .(ejam_uniq_id,blockid,distance,blockwt,bgid, block_radius_miles), on = 'blockid']
  # b) try to do join that updates sites2blocks by making a copy? This does work:
  
  sites2blocks <-  blockwts[sites2blocks, .(ejam_uniq_id, blockid, distance, blockwt, bgid, block_radius_miles), on = 'blockid'] 
  
  # 2 ways considered here for how exactly to make the adjustment: 
  
  sites2blocks[distance < block_radius_miles, distance := 0.9 * block_radius_miles]  # assumes distance is in miles
  # or a more continuous adjustment for when dist is between 0.9 and 1.0 times block_radius_miles: 
  # sites2blocks_dt[ , distance  := pmax(block_radius_miles, distance, na.rm = TRUE)] # assumes distance is in miles
  
  # drop that info about area or size of block to save memory. do not need it later in sites2blocks
  sites2blocks[ , block_radius_miles := NULL]
  ######################################## #
  
  sites2blocks[ , distance.km := pmax(countradius * km_per_mile, distance * km_per_mile, na.rm = TRUE)] 
  
  # that would convert distance from miles to km not meters !!
  # collapse::fmin() is probably much faster
  
  
  # 3)     and for those, check again to see if new d is still <= radius. keep only if d<=radius now. *** 
  # 4) for each frompoints, if no distances were found, get nearest single d at any radius,
  #       originally thought perhaps by expanding outwards step by step until at least one is found (but not worth the overhead vs just finding ALL d and picking min)
  
  # steps 3 and 4 had not yet been implemented as of 1/29/23.  
  
  # 8.04672 miles is 5 km which is the EJScreen max search range for proximity scores
