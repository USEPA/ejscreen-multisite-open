<h2 id="epas-ej-analysis-multi-site-ejam-tool">EPA’s EJ Analysis Multi-site (EJAM) tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#epas-ej-analysis-multi-site-ejam-tool"></a>
</h2>
<p>EJAM is a toolkit that will be powering the new “multi-site” features
in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen" class="external-link uri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" title="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen">EJScreen</a> Developed by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), EJAM makes it
easy to see demographic and environmental information summarized in and
across multiple sites. These sites could include any list of places in
the nation, such as the areas near certain facilities or places defined
in various other ways.</p>
<p>Using EJAM’s tools is a way of running EJScreen reports for hundreds
or thousands of places, all at the same time.</p>
<p>EJScreen will be able to provide new features by leveraging EJAM’s
toolkit. This will allow anyone to quickly see a summary across hundreds
of areas, explore interactive maps, tables, and plots, and download a
summary or detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This provides interactive results and a formatted, ready-to-share
report with written explanations of the results, tables, and graphics.
The report can provide EJ-related information about people who live in
communities potentially affected by any of the industrial facilities on
a list, for example.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="using-the-new-features">Using the new features<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-the-new-features"></a>
</h3>
<p>To use the tool, one first selects the places to be analyzed. This
could be, for example, everyone within 2 miles of any EPA-regulated
facility in a specific NAICS code (industrial sector). Or it could be a
list of areas defined in any user-provided mapping data, such as from
modeling or monitoring data, geographic boundaries, service areas, or
other geospatial information.</p>
<p>The tool runs a fast “buffer” or proximity analysis at each location,
just like EJScreen would provide a standard report for a single
location, except EJAM does this for each of a large number of locations
very quickly. Then, most importantly, EJAM provides a complete overview
report, to summarize environmental conditions and demographics across
all the populations and all of the locations. The results can be
explored interactively or downloaded as a written report with text,
tables, and graphics.</p>
<p>The summary report can quickly and easily show which demographic
groups live near the selected facilities. It also provides new insights
into which environmental stressors may affect certain demographic
subgroups disproportionately, to varying degrees, near a regulated
sector overall and at individual sites. This allows EJ analysis to move
beyond looking at a small number of indicators for a few demographic
groups, at one site in a single permitting decision, to a more complete
picture of conditions near a whole set of facilities that is the focus
of a risk analysis or a new regulation being considered, for
example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="features-and-benefits">Features and benefits<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#features-and-benefits"></a>
</h3>
<p>This new tool provides a ready-to-use summary report, plus more
flexibility, accuracy, and speed than other tools have in the past. The
website quickly provides results on the fly – The software was optimized
to be extremely fast (allowing realtime exploratory work), while still
using the same block-population calculation EJScreen has been using,
making it more consistent with how EJScreen has always worked and more
accurate than other approaches (e.g., using “areal apportionment” of
tracts or block groups, like some other tools have used).</p>
<p>The new tool also lets one pick locations through several different
approaches, such as - specifying facility points by industry categories
of various types (NAICS, SIC, EPA program, etc.) - providing a table of
point locations given as latitudes and longitudes - using shapefiles
with polygons (e.g., from the results of air quality modeling work) -
selecting Census units to compare, such as Counties</p>
<p>The default demographic indicators are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen" title="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen" class="external-link">EJScreen
basic demographic indicators</a>, with the addition of race/ethnicity
subgroups, and other selected demographic indicators that EJScreen
provides.</p>
<p>Also, the data and software are shared as reusable, well-documented
functions in an R package, to allow software developers or analysts to
take advantage of these resources in running their own analyses or
building or supplementing their own tools, websites, or mobile apps.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="updates">Updates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#updates"></a>
</h3>
<p>Data updates are synchronized with EJScreen data updates and main
version numbers, so EJScreen 2.3 (the version released in mid-2024) and
EJAM 2.3 use the same data. Version 2.3 has ACS 2018-2022 block group
demographics and Census 2020 block weights.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="speed">Speed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#speed"></a>
</h3>
<p>The power of this tool enables faster and more accurate results than
other tools generally have been able to provide. It also should be much
more cost-effective and easy to use than the standard geospatial
analysis solutions would be. This tool lets any user very quickly see an
analysis of a very large number of places, and immediately get a
ready-to-use report that provides perspective on an entire industrial
sector or set of places.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#accuracy"></a>
</h3>
<p>EJAM and EJScreen use the same approach to characterizing populations
at each site, to maintain consistency and avoid any confusion. Compared
to other often-used approaches, EJScreen/EJAM use high-resolution
buffering to provide more accurate information about which populations
live inside a buffer, which is important in rural areas where a single
blockgroup can cover a very large area. For circular buffers, the
internal points of Census 2020 blocks are used, not areal apportionment
of block groups, to estimate where residents live within each block
group. This avoids the simplistic assumption that people are evenly
spread out within each block group. Instead, it uses blocks to get
information about which part of a block group is where residents
actually live. There are several million blocks in the US, as compared
with fewer than a quarter million block groups. The only more accurate
approaches are 1) to use areal apportionment of blocks (not block
groups), but that is very slow, or 2) to use something like the 30x30
meter grid EPA developed using dasymetric estimates of where people live
at even higher resolution than a block, but that requires large amounts
of storage and computer time.</p>
<p>EJAM calculations also take note of which residences are near which
sites, to avoid double-counting people in the summary statistics but
still allow a user to view results for one site at a time. This is
something other tools and analyses often cannot provide - when they
aggregate across sites they typically do not retain the statistics on
individual sites, and rarely if ever keep track of which communities are
near multiple facilities. Keeping track of this would also allow an
analyst to explore how many people are near multiple sites, or ask which
sites in communities that already have multiple sites nearby.</p>
<p>EJAM was designed so that it can provide an essentially continuous
distribution of distances, as distributed across blocks or people for
one or all of the nearby facilities. This enables exploration of the
complete picture of proximities, rather than using an arbitrary single
distance defining near versus far. The distribution can be sliced later
for the summary statistics at any distance, and can be summarized as a
distribution of distances within each demographic group.</p>
