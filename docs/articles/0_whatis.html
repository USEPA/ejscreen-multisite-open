</h2>
<p>EJAM is a tool, developed by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (US EPA) that makes it easy to see demographic and
environmental information summarized in and across any list of places in
the nation. Using EJAM is like running an EJScreen report, but for
hundreds or thousands of places, all at the same time.</p>
<p>EJScreen will be able to leverage EJAM’s technology to let you
quickly check a summary report, explore interactive maps, tables, and
plots, and download a summary or detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This provides interactive results and a formatted, ready-to-share
report with written explanations of the results, tables, and graphics.
The report can provide EJ-related information about people who live in
communities near any of the industrial facilities on a list, for
example.</p>

</h3>
<p>EJAM is a user-friendly web application that can summarize
demographics and environmental conditions for any list of places in the
nation. It provides interactive results and a formatted, ready-to-share
report with written explanations of the results, tables, and graphics.
The report can provide EJ-related information about people who live in
communities near any of the industrial facilities on a list, for
example.</p>
<p>To use the tool, one first selects the places to be analyzed. This
could be, for example, everyone within 2 miles of any EPA-regulated
facility in a specific NAICS code (industrial sector). The tool runs a
fast “buffer” or proximity analysis at each location, similar to how
EJScreen provides a standard report for a single location, except EJAM
does this for each of a large number of locations very quickly. Then,
most importantly, EJAM provides a complete overview report, to summarize
environmental conditions and demographics across all the populations and
all of the locations. The results can be explored interactively or
downloaded as a written report with text, tables, and graphics.</p>
<p>An EJAM report can quickly and easily show which demographic groups
live near the selected facilities. It also provides new insights into
which environmental stressors may affect certain demographic subgroups
disproportionately, to varying degrees, near a regulated sector overall
and at individual sites. This allows EJ analysis to move beyond looking
at a small number of indicators for a few demographic groups, at one
site in a single permitting decision, to a more complete picture of
conditions near a whole set of facilities that is the focus of a risk
analysis or a new regulation being considered, for example.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="ejam-features-and-benefits">EJAM features and benefits<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ejam-features-and-benefits"></a>
</h3>
<p>EJAM provides a ready-to-use summary report, plus more flexibility,
accuracy, and speed than other tools have. The web-based app quickly
provides results on the fly – The circular buffering module was
optimized to be extremely fast (allowing realtime exploratory work in an
app), while still using the block-population calculation EJScreen uses,
making it more consistent with EJScreen and more accurate than other
approaches.</p>
<p>EJAM also lets one pick locations through several different
approaches, such as - specifying facility points by industry categories
of various types (NAICS, SIC, EPA program, etc.) - providing a table of
latitudes/longitudes of a list of points - using shapefiles with
polygons - selecting Census units to compare, such as Counties, based on
FIPS codes</p>
<p>The default demographic indicators are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen" title="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen" class="external-link">EJScreen
basic demographic indicators</a>, with the addition of race/ethnicity
subgroups.</p>
<p>The data and software are shared as reusable, well-documented
functions or modules in an R package, to allow software developers or
analysts to take advantage of these resources in running their own
analyses or building or supplementing their own tools, websites, or
mobile apps.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="updates">Updates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#updates"></a>
</h3>
<p>EJAM data updates are meant to match EJScreen scheduled updates and
main version numbers, so EJAM 2.2 uses the same basic data as EJScreen
2.2 (the version used from mid-2023 through early 2024). Version 2.2 had
ACS 2017-2021 block group demographics and Census 2020 block weights.
The mid-2024 versions of EJScreen and EJAM likewise use the same data,
including ACS 2018-2022.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="speed">Speed<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#speed"></a>
</h3>
<p>The power of this tool enables faster and more accurate results than
other tools generally have been able to provide. It also should be much
more cost-effective and easy to use than the standard geospatial
analysis solutions would be. This tool lets any user very quickly see an
analysis of a very large number of places, and immediately get a
ready-to-use report that provides perspective on an entire industrial
sector or set of places.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#accuracy"></a>
</h3>
<p>Compared to other often-used approaches, EJAM high-resolution
buffering provides more accurate information about which populations
live inside a buffer, which is important in rural areas where a single
blockgroup can cover a very large area. For circular buffers, EJAM uses
the locations of internal points of Census 2020 blocks, not areal
apportionment of block groups, to estimate where residents live within
each block group. This avoids the simplistic assumption that people are
evenly spread out within each block group. Instead, it uses blocks to
get information about which part of a block group is where residents
actually live. There are several million blocks in the US, as compared
with fewer than a quarter million block groups. The only more accurate
approaches than what EJAM uses are 1) to use areal apportionment of
blocks (not block groups), but that is very slow, or 2) to use the 30x30
meter grid EPA developed based on dasymetric estimates of where people
live at even higher resolution than a block, but that requires large
amounts of storage and computer time. EJAM was designed to replicate
EJScreen methods and results for any given location, such as the total
population count within 1 mile, to maintain consistency and avoid any
confusion.</p>
<p>EJAM also takes note of which residences are near which sites, to
avoid double-counting people in the summary statistics but still allow a
user to view results for one site at a time. This is something other
tools and analyses often cannot provide - when they aggregate across
sites they typically do not retain the statistics on individual sites,
and rarely if ever keep track of which communities are near multiple
facilities. Keeping track of this would also allow an analyst to explore
how many people are near multiple sites, or ask which sites in
communities that already have multiple sites nearby.</p>
<p>EJAM was designed so that it can provide a continuous distribution of
distances, as distributed across blocks or people for one or all of the
nearby facilities. This enables exploration of the complete picture of
proximities, rather than using an arbitrary single distance defining
near versus far. The distribution can be sliced later for the summary
statistics at any distance, and can be summarized as a distribution of
distances within each demographic group.</p>
