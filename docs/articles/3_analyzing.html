<ul>
<li><p><strong>run_app()</strong> to launch the web app locally (to run
in RStudio on a single computer rather than on a server)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ejamit()</strong> provides most results in just one
function, and they can be viewed using ejam2report() and ejam2excel().
Sample input to ejamit() is in testpoints_10 and sample output is in
testoutput_ejamit_10pts_1miles. ejamit() especially relies on
getblocksnearby() and doaggregate():</p></li>
<li><p>getblocksnearby() takes a set of points (e.g., facilities) and
finds the Census blocks near each. Sample input is in testpoints_100,
and sample output is in testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles</p></li>
<li><p>doaggregate() takes the list of blocks near each point, joins it
to blockgroup indicators like from EJScreen, and aggregates at each
buffered point as well as for the overall set of unique blocks
(residents). Sample input is in testoutput_getblocksnearby_10pts_1miles
and sample output is in testoutput_doaggregate_10pts_1miles</p></li>

<li>The overall functions ejamit(), ejam2report(), ejam2excel()</li>
<li>Specify Points by Lat/Lon</li>
<li>Specify Facilities by ID</li>

</h2>
<p>EJAM offers a variety of ways to specify the places to be analyzed
and compared. Once you specify some list of places, EJAM will analyze
them as a whole (overall), and also individually so that you can compare
places to each other.</p>
<p>Places analyzed and compared can be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points, defining all residents within X miles of each point</li>
<li>Polygons (from shapefiles), such as redlining zones, higher risk
areas based on modeling, etc.</li>
<li>Census Units such as Counties or other types of Census Units defined
by FIPS code (e.g., Counties in one State)</li>
</ul>
<p>Groups will be available in another type of analysis, not yet
implemented. Groups will let you get statistics for each group, to
compare categories of places. Whole groups of points/ polygons/ census
areas will be treated as the units of analysis. This will allow you to
define groups of points, for example, and get a summary for each group,
such as residents near any of the facilities of one type. This enables
comparison of categories of places, such as analyzing 3 types of
facilities at once with results aggregated for each type, or comparing
redlining zones grouped by grade, or comparing areas with some feature
(poor air quality, or receiving grants, etc.) versus areas without that
trait, all limited to one State or Region, for example.</p>
<p>To analyze points and the circular areas around each one, you can
specify the points in two basic ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of points defined by coordinates or by EPA ID numbers for
each point</li>
<li>All points that are the locations of EPA-regulated facilities of a
certain type. The categories that can be used include the
following:</li>
<li>EPA Program (e.g., all greenhouse gas reporting facilities)</li>
<li>Industry type, based on NAICS code (e.g., )</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>You can define locations as all residents within X miles of any one
or more of the specified points, and you can define those points in a
few ways. One way is to upload a table of coordinates – latitude and
longitude for each point, one row per site, with columns called lat and
lon (or some synonyms that work).</p>
<p>The simplest way to do that in the RStudio console is to do something
like <code>x &lt;- ejamit(radius=1)</code>, and it prompts you to upload
a spreadsheet with lat lon columns.</p>
<p>You can also specify a set of facilities by uploading their Registry
ID numbers in a table, or using other identifiers. For example, there is
a function <code><a href="../reference/latlon_from_programid.html">latlon_from_programid()</a></code> in the examples
below.</p>
<p>You can define circular buffers around a set of EPA-regulated
facilities in a few other ways as well, such as by NAICS (or SIC)
industry names or codes, EPA program covering the set of facilities
(e.g., all greenhouse gas reporters), or a Clean Air Act MACT
subpart.</p>

<p>You can specify sites by NAICS, but it is important to note the FRS
lacks NAICS info for many regulated facilities!</p>
