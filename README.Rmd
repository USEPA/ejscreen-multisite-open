# Developer note: 
# If you use index.Rmd or README.Rmd it is your responsibility to 
# knit the document to create the corresponding .md. 
# pkgdown does not do this for you because it only touches 
# files in the ⁠doc/⁠ directory.
#
# 1) Edit your README.Rmd file (the .Rmd NOT the .md file)
# 2) Build your README.md file from the README.Rmd file, by clicking Knit in RStudio
#   also check     devtools::build_readme()  ?
#
# 3) Commit both your README.Rmd and README.md
#
# You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render
# `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here:
# <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
#
# Then... 
#    - **See ?pkgdown::build_site** - EJAM now uses the pkgdown R package to build help and vignettes as web pages, and it uses the README.md (not .Rmd) to help build the documentation.

EJAM makes it easy to see demographic and environmental information summarized in and across any list of places in the nation. Using EJAM is like running an EJScreen report, but for hundreds or thousands of places, all at the same time. EJAM lets you quickly check a summary report, explore interactive maps, tables, and plots, and download a summary or detailed spreadsheet. The GIS methods are as accurate as what EJScreen uses but highly optimized to be very fast.

[The EJAM R Package for Analysts and Developers] written in the R programming language, with source code on GitHub. When used in RStudio, the EJAM package provides functions to help analysts work with block group data, points, and polygons, to very quickly aggregate and compare large numbers of locations. Note that EJAM also can be used as a web app by R/RStudio users if the package is installed and the shiny app is launched locally on a user's own computer.

EJScreen will be able to leverage EJAM's technology to provide public access to batches of reports. EJAM itself is not an app running on a public website. A user-friendly web app will be made available to the public in the future, either as part of EJScreen (based on EJAM code) or as a separate EJAM app. A web app was being tested for internal use at EPA as of early 2024.

EJAM is provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and is being actively developed so that new versions will continue to be tested and released over time.

## Open-Source Code Policy

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf) applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Federal Source Code Policy. In general, it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in the [System Life Cycle Management Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm). EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [EPA Open Source Project Repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects) and [EPA's Interim Open Source Code Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements).
