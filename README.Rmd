# EJAM

## EPA's Environmental Justice Analysis Multi-site tool

EJAM is a user-friendly web app, provided by the US EPA, that can summarize demographics and environmental conditions for any list of places in the nation. It provides interactive results and a formatted, ready-to-share report with written explanations of the results, tables, and graphics. The report can provide EJ-related information about people who live in communities near any of the industrial facilities on a list, for example.

**Note that EJAM is still in active development, not yet released for anything other than testing, even internally. For an interim, related tool being tested, please see** [EJAM's ejscreenapi tool](https://rstudio-connect.dmap-stage.aws.epa.gov/content/dc3cda00-20a2-47ed-a753-0dcb89eb8f2a/ "https://rstudio-connect.dmap-stage.aws.epa.gov/content/dc3cda00-20a2-47ed-a753-0dcb89eb8f2a/")

# What is EJAM?

EJAM is a user-friendly web app, provided by the US EPA, that can summarize demographics and environmental conditions for any list of places in the nation. It provides interactive results and a formatted, ready-to-share report with written explanations of the results, tables, and graphics. The report can provide EJ-related information about people who live in communities near any of the industrial facilities on a list, for example.

To use the tool, one first selects the places to be analyzed. This could be, for example, everyone within 2 miles of any EPA-regulated facility in a specific NAICS code (industrial sector). The tool runs a fast "buffer" or proximity analysis at each location, similar to how EJScreen provides a standard report for a single location, except EJAM does this for each of a large number of locations very quickly. Then, most importantly, EJAM provides a complete overview report, to summarize environmental conditions and demographics across all the populations and all of the locations. The results can be explored interactively or downloaded as a written report with text, tables, and graphics.

An EJAM report can quickly and easily show which demographic groups live near the selected facilities. It also provides new insights into which environmental stressors may affect certain demographic subgroups disproportionately, to varying degrees, near a regulated sector overall and at individual sites. This allows EJ analysis to move beyond looking at a small number of indicators for a few demographic groups, at one site in a single permitting decision, to a more complete picture of conditions near a whole set of facilities that is the focus of a risk analysis or a new regulation being considered, for example.

## Documentation

See the vignette, and help documentation for the package. 

The app is not on a server, but can be installed locally as an R package, and the data or functions can be used even without launching the shiny app interface. This is work in progress - only the lat/lon upload may be working right now, for example, not the NAICS/FRS queries.

## EJAM features and benefits

EJAM provides a ready-to-use summary report, plus more flexibility, accuracy, and speed than other tools have. The web-based app quickly provides a written report plus interactive tables and graphics. Default indicators will include those in [EJScreen](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen) plus a few others (e.g., demog. subgroups), but user-selected and user-provided indicators could also be analyzed. The circular buffering module was optimized to be extremely fast (allowing realtime exploratory work in an app), while still using the block-population calculation EJScreen uses, making it more consistent with EJScreen and more accurate than some other approaches.

Building on existing tools such as EJScreen and other environmental and demographic mapping tools, EJAM provides new levels of flexibility and power:

### Easy to use with standard default settings, but flexible for power users

The tool uses default indicators but is flexible enough for work with other environmental and demographic indicators. The default environmental indicators are [EJScreen's environmental indicators](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-environmental-indicators-ejscreen "https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-environmental-indicators-ejscreen"), but an analysis can also include other user-selected EPA-hosted data layers on risks or concentrations (at block group resolution), or user-provided scores for each block group.

The default demographic indicators are be [EJScreen's basic demographic indicators](https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen "https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen/overview-demographic-indicators-ejscreen"), with the addition of the 8 race/ethnicity subgroups in ACS5 Table B03002 and % poor as derived from Table C17002. EJAM can also analyze other demographic indicators, to include user-selected EPA-hosted layers, or user-provided data. See [ACSDT5Y2019.B03002](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?hidePreview=true&tid=ACSDT5Y2019.B03002) and [ACSDT5Y2019.C17002](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?hidePreview=true&tid=ACSDT5Y2019.C17002)

When using the tool, one should be able to use various approaches to defining the areas to be analyzed, using shapefiles rather than just circular buffers.

The tool also uses a default, standard report, but allows flexibility beyond that. EJAM provides a standard report (text, graphics, and maps) to print, download, and use, but that a user could further edit offline (e.g., in Word). Users also can download individual graphics and data files (for individual sites and summary statistics).

The results also can be viewed interactively, where one can adjust certain aspects of the analysis and outputs (and that could possibly flow into the summary report as well) such as preferred graphics/ tables, indicator thresholds, reference groups, reference areas, metrics, etc.), to make the outputs fit a given user's needs.

To provide further flexibility and help avoid duplication of effort, EJAM's API would provide access to services such as fast buffering, summarization, or data.

Also, open source software components will be shared as reusable well-documented modular tools, to allow developers or others to take advantage of these resources in running their own analyses or building or supplementing their own tools, websites, or mobile apps.

### Speed and accuracy

The power of this tool enables faster and more accurate results than other tools generally have been able to provide. It also should be much more cost-effective as a public tool than the standard buffering solution would be, given how GIS analysis credits are used in the geoplatform. This tool lets any user very quickly see an analysis of a very large number of places (which EJScreen cannot offer the public), and immediately get a ready-to-use report that provides perspective on an entire industrial sector or set of places.

EJAM data updates are meant to match EJScreen's scheduled updates and main version numbers, so EJAM 2.1 will use the same basic data as EJScreen 2.1. The 2.1 version (starting October 2022) has up-to-date demographic data (e.g., Census 2020 block weights and ACS 2016-2020 block group demographics). Compared to other approaches, EJAM's high-resolution buffering provides more accurate information about which populations live inside a buffer, which is important in rural areas where a single blockgroup can cover a very large area. For circular buffers, EJAM 2.1 uses the locations of internal points of Census 2020 blocks, not areal apportionment of block groups, to estimate where residents live within each block group. This essentially assumes people are evenly spread out within each block, not each block group, and treats the block population as if they were all located at the block's internal point. There are several million blocks in the US, . The only more accurate approaches are to use areal apportionment of blocks (not block groups), but that is very slow, or to use a 30x30 meter grid based on dasymetric estimates of where people live at even higher resolution than a block, but\
It also should closely replicate EJScreen's results for a single location, to avoid public confusion and inconsistency.

EJAM also takes note of which residences are near which sites, to avoid double-counting people in the summary statistics but still allow a user to view results for one site at a time. This is something other tools and analyses often cannot provide - when they aggregate across sites they typically do not retain the statistics on individual sites, and rarely if ever keep track of which communities are near multiple facilities. Keeping track of this would also allow an analyst to explore how many people are near multiple sites, or ask which sites in communities that already have multiple sites nearby.

The intent is for EJAM to be designed so that a later enhancement can provide a continuous distribution of distances, as distributed across blocks or people for one or all of the nearby facilities. This would enable exploration of the complete picture of proximities, rather than using an arbitrary single distance defining near versus far. The distribution could be sliced later for the summary statistics at any distance, or could be summarized as a distribution of distances within each demographic group.

Another goal is for EJAM to be designed with growth in mind, assuming that the specific indicators of interest will expand or change over time. It is even possible that multiple resolutions of data will need to be analyzed, such as block, block group, and tract data for different indicators. A subsequent refinement might even use a high-resolution raster grid of population estimates rather than the Census Block counts currently used for buffering and weighting block group scores for partially included block groups.
