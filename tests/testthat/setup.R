## Some test cases we could use for inputs error checking:

bad_number <- list(
  num0len = numeric(0L), matrix_1x1 = matrix(1), array1 = array(1),  # these might be OK 
  NA1 = NA, NULL1 = NULL, TRUE1 = TRUE, # these  might be acceptable if you need a single number, for some functions, since can do math/ they could be coerced  
  text1 = "1", character1 = "A", 
  list1 = list(1), listempty = list(), 
  df1 = data.frame(1),
  vector2 = 1:2, array2 = array(1:2), matrix_1row_4col = matrix(1:4, nrow = 1), matrix_4row_1col = matrix(1:4, nrow = 4), matrix_2x2 = matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
  )
## to look at this list of objects:
#nix <- sapply(1:length(bad_number), function(z) {cat( "\n\n\n------------------------\n\n  ", names(bad_number)[z], "\n\n\n" ); print( bad_number[z][[1]] )}); rm(nix)
## which ones are length >1, numeric, atomic, or ok to use in math
# x <- data.frame(
#   length0or1 = sapply(bad_number, function(z) try(length(z) < 2)), 
#   isnumeric  = sapply(bad_number, function(z) try(is.numeric(z))),   
#   isatomic   = sapply(bad_number, function(z) try(is.atomic( z))), 
#   canadd     = sapply(bad_number, function(z) try(is.numeric(z + 9)))
#   )
# x


# # Run after all tests
# # Setup code is typically best used to create external resources that are needed by many tests. Itâ€™s best kept to a minimum because you will have to manually run it before interactively debugging tests.
# # But, is this right?  it is from the help example but what is cleanup() ?? ***
