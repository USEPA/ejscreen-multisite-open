EJAM makes it easy to see demographic and environmental information
summarized in and across any list of places in the nation. Using EJAM is
like running an EJScreen report, but for hundreds or thousands of
places, all at the same time. EJAM lets you quickly check a summary
report, explore interactive maps, tables, and plots, and download a
summary or detailed spreadsheet. The GIS methods are as accurate as what
EJScreen uses but highly optimized to be very fast.

[The EJAM R Package for Analysts and
Developers](#the-ejam-r-package-for-analysts-and-developers) written in
the R programming language, with source code on GitHub. When used in
RStudio, the EJAM package provides functions to help analysts work with
block group data, points, and polygons, to very quickly aggregate and
compare large numbers of locations. Note that EJAM also can be used as a
web app by R/RStudio users if the package is installed and the shiny app
is launched locally on a user’s own computer.

EJScreen will be able to leverage EJAM’s technology to provide public
access to batches of reports. EJAM itself is not an app running on a
public website. A user-friendly interface will be made available to the
public in the future, as part of EJScreen (based on EJAM code). EJAM was
being tested for internal use at EPA as of early 2024.

EJAM is provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and
is being actively developed so that new versions will continue to be
tested and released over time.

## Open-Source Code Policy

Effective August 8, 2016, the [OMB Mandate: M-16-21; Federal Source Code
Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through
Reusable and Open Source
Software](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf)
applies to new custom-developed code created or procured by EPA
consistent with the scope and applicability requirements of Office of
Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) Federal Source Code Policy. In general,
it states that all new custom-developed code by Federal Agencies should
be made available and reusable as open-source code.

The EPA specific implementation of OMB Mandate M-16-21 is addressed in
the [System Life Cycle Management
Procedure](https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/policy-procedures-and-guidance-system-life-cycle-management-slcm).
EPA has chosen to use GitHub as its version control system as well as
its inventory of open-source code projects. EPA uses GitHub to inventory
its custom-developed, open-source code and generate the necessary
metadata file that is then posted to code.gov for broad reuse in
compliance with OMB Mandate M-16-21.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [EPA Open
Source Project Repo](https://github.com/USEPA/open-source-projects) and
[EPA’s Interim Open Source Code
Guidance](https://www.epa.gov/developers/open-source-software-and-epa-code-repository-requirements).
