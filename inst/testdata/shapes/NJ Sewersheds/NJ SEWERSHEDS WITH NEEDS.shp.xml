This is a graphical representation of the States Sewer Service Area (SSA) mapping. The SSA mapping shows the planned method of wastewater disposal for specific areas, i.e. whether the wastewater will be collected to a regional treatment facility or treated on site and disposed of through a Surface Water (SW) discharge or a groundwater (GW) discharge. Areas not specifically mapped represent either water features where no construction will occur or land areas that default to individual subsurface disposal systems discharging less than 2,000 gallons/day (gpd) where the site conditions and existing regulations allow. This mapping, in conjunction with the text of the associated Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP), is used to make consistency determinations under the Water Quality Management (WQM) Planning rules, N.J.A.C. 7:15. The SSA mapping is prepared under the Water Quality Management (WQM) Planning rules, N.J.A.C. 7:15 in conjunction with the Statewide WQM Plan, which together constitute the Continuing Planning Process conducted pursuant to the Water Quality Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 58:11A-1 et seq., the Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A-1 et seq., and N.J.S.A. 13:1D-1 et seq., and as required by Sections 303(e) and 208 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.)&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</idAbs><idPurp>The Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) administers the WQM Planning rules, N.J.A.C. 7:15, in conjunction with the Statewide WQM Plan, which together constitute the Continuing Planning Process conducted pursuant to the Water Quality Planning Act, N.J.S.A. 58:11A-1 et seq., the Water Pollution Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10A-1 et seq., and N.J.S.A. 13:1D-1 et seq., and as required by Sections 303(e) and 208 of the Federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). According to these regulations, the Commissioner of the DEP shall not undertake, or authorize through the issuance of a permit, any project or activity that conflicts with the applicable sections of adopted WQM Plans or the WQM Planning rules. The existing rules establish a mechanism for the determination of consistency between proposed projects or activities requiring Departmentally issued permits and the WQM Plans. One component of the WQM Plans is a Wastewater Management Plan (WMP). A WMP is a document that provides 20 year planning for wastewater and certain other water quality concerns for a specific planning area. SSA mapping is required to be prepared for all WMP's and is used in conjunction with the text of the adopted plans to determine consistency between projects and the WQM Planning rules, N.J.A.C. 7:15</idPurp><idStatus><ProgCd value="001"/></idStatus><idPoC><rpIndName>Matthew LaMarca</rpIndName><rpOrgName>NJDEP - Office of Water Resources Management Coordination</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum>609-633-7053</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType="postal"><delPoint>401 East State Street</delPoint><city>Trenton</city><adminArea>NJ</adminArea><postCode>08625</postCode><eMailAdd>Matthew.LaMarca@dep.nj.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntInstr>via email</cntInstr></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="007"/></role></idPoC><resMaint><maintFreq><MaintFreqCd value="006"/></maintFreq></resMaint><placeKeys><keyword>New Jersey</keyword></placeKeys><themeKeys><keyword>Consistency Determination</keyword><keyword>Water Quality</keyword><keyword>sewers</keyword><keyword>planning</keyword><keyword>Continuing Planning Process</keyword><keyword>Sewer Service Area</keyword><keyword>Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)</keyword><keyword>Wastewater Management Plan</keyword><keyword>Wastewater Facilities Planning 201</keyword></themeKeys><themeKeys><thesaName><resTitle>User</resTitle></thesaName><keyword>NJDEP</keyword><keyword>Util_wastewater_servicearea</keyword><keyword>statessa</keyword></themeKeys><themeKeys><thesaName><resTitle>EPA GIS Keyword Thesaurus</resTitle></thesaName><keyword>Area</keyword><keyword>Waste</keyword></themeKeys><themeKeys><thesaName><resTitle>NJGIN</resTitle></thesaName><keyword>njfw_critical</keyword></themeKeys><themeKeys><thesaName><resTitle>ISO 19115 Topic Category</resTitle></thesaName><keyword>utilitiesCommunication</keyword></themeKeys><searchKeys><keyword>NJDEP</keyword><keyword>Consistency Determination</keyword><keyword>Util_wastewater_servicearea</keyword><keyword>Water Quality</keyword><keyword>New Jersey</keyword><keyword>statessa</keyword><keyword>njfw_critical</keyword><keyword>sewers</keyword><keyword>planning</keyword><keyword>Continuing Planning Process</keyword><keyword>Sewer Service Area</keyword><keyword>Area</keyword><keyword>Waste</keyword><keyword>Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP)</keyword><keyword>Wastewater Management Plan</keyword><keyword>New Jersey</keyword><keyword>utilitiesCommunication</keyword><keyword>Wastewater Facilities Planning 201</keyword><keyword>NJDEPTrentonMetadata</keyword></searchKeys><resConst><LegConsts><useLimit>This organization provides the geographic data "as is".

The maps were prepared to many different standards. In an effort to consolidate the mapping into a consistent format and make the mapping easily accessible over the internet, the Division of Watershed Management (DWM) converted the SSA mapping into a digital GIS format which it proposed as an amendment to the twelve Areawide Water Quality Management Plans on October 17, 2005. This mapping was prepared by the staff of the DWM by scanning and digitizing the existing SSA mapping then adding the subsequently adopted amendments to WMPs either by scanning and digitizing or by drawing in using the USGS quadrangle mapping as a basemap. Where no adopted WMP was available, the most recent information on service areas included in the Areawide Plans was used, including from the following sources: narrative, plan amendment mapping, and 201 facilities plan mapping. In some cases, service area mapping from draft WMPs was used to represent existing service areas. The Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act (Highlands Act), N.J.S.A. 13:20-1 et seq. signed on August 10, 2004, repealed all SSA in the Highlands Preservation Area where collection pipes had not been constructed. The SSA in the Highlands Preservation Area was revised based on a limited number of responses to the Departments request for in ground sanitary sewer mapping, staff knowledge, review of Department permits and a review of the 2002 aerial photography to locate existing development. The revised mapping was then sent out for verification by the Sewer Authorities and Municipalities within the Highlands Preservation Area.</suppInfo><dataChar><CharSetCd value="004"/></dataChar><envirDesc>Microsoft Windows 7 Version 6.1 (Build 7601) Service Pack 1; Esri ArcGIS 10.3.1.4959</envirDesc><dataExt><geoEle><GeoBndBox esriExtentType="search"><exTypeCode>1</exTypeCode><westBL>-75.579693</westBL><eastBL>-73.909317</eastBL><northBL>41.356134</northBL><southBL>38.925838</southBL></GeoBndBox></geoEle></dataExt><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="015"/></tpCat><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="019"/></tpCat></dataIdInfo><dqInfo><dqScope><scpLvl><ScopeCd value="005"/></scpLvl></dqScope><report type="DQTopConsis"><evalMethDesc>For 20141017 version, topology check was run for overlaps and slivers.

During the process of reviewing the mapping, staff also identified additional areas where the proposal differed from the adopted paper mapping and these areas were added, deleted or had the boundaries adjusted. New amendments adopted since the proposal was made have also been added into the mapping. The domain values for the "type" attribute were also revised. The domain value "GW &gt; 20,000" was removed since it is not a valid classification set by the WQM Planning Rules, N.J.A.C. 7:15, and a new domain value "GWIND" was added to represent ground water discharges which have individual NJPDES permits.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2006-10-01T00:00:00</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Matthew LaMarca</rpIndName><rpOrgName>NJDEP - Office of Water Resources Management Coordination</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum tddtty="">609-633-7053</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>401 East State Street</delPoint><city>Trenton</city><adminArea>NJ</adminArea><postCode>08625</postCode><eMailAdd>Matthew.LaMarca@dep.nj.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntInstr>via email</cntInstr></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="007"/></role></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>New amendments adopted since the adoption of the mapping on October 11, 2006, have been added into the mapping.

This site was identified in the WMP as a discharge to groundwater SSA for 30,813 gallons per day (gpd). The site was originally approved for a proposed warehouse to be served by an on-site discharge to groundwater treatment plant in the WMP, which was adopted by the Department on November 20, 2012. 9) This amendment, entitled “Tyler Village”, submitted on behalf of Tyler Properties LLC, expands the Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) sewer service area (SSA) by 18 acres to allow for the construction of 65 two-bedroom apartments and 35 three-bedroom apartments. The amendment site is located in South Plainfield Borough on a portion of Block 467, Lot 21 at the intersection of Tyler Place and New Brunswick Avenue. The entire proposed development is for 460 apartments and 10,000 square feet of retail space, however, 360 of these apartments and all of the retail space are in the presently adopted SSA and are not the subject of this amendment. 10) This amendment, entitled “The Morris Companies”, submitted on behalf of the Trenton Road Corporation, expands the Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) sewage treatment plant (STP) sewer service area (SSA) by approximately 16 acres. The amendment site is located in Monroe Township on a portion of Block 82, Lot 3.01 east of Cranbury South River Road (Route 535) and north of Brown’s Corner Road (Route 522). 11) This amendment, submitted on behalf of Middlesex Energy Center LLC, expands the sewer service area (SSA) of the Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) by 8.19 acres to serve a proposed combined cycle power plant. The project site is located in Sayreville Borough, Middlesex County on portions of: (Block 57.02/Lot 1; Block 57.04/Lot 1; and Block 57.05/Lot 1) now known as Block 58, Lot 9, which is west of Jernee Mill Road (Route 675) and east of the South River. 12) This amendment, entitled “Metuchen/South River/North Brunswick Sewer Service Area”, submitted by the Middlesex County Department of Planning on behalf of the Middlesex County Board of Chosen Freeholders, expands the Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) sewer service area (SSA) to add 4 separate sites totaling 42.43 (not 46 acres as stated in the October 8, 2015 preliminary notice which was published in the October 21, 2015 DEP Bulletin) to the MCUA sewer service area. The four sites are located in the following municipalities in Middlesex County: Metuchen Borough (Site 1) - portions of the following lots: Block 37/ Lots 5.12, 5.22, 16.02, 17.01, 17.02, Block 39/Lot 40 (portions of the following lots in Site 1 that had been originally proposed to be included in the SSA will not be added to the SSA with this adoption: Block 37/Lots 16.03, 20, Block 37.01/Lot 16, Block 38/Lot 1.); South River Borough (Site 2) - Block 49/Lots 1.01, 2 (portion), Block 68/Lot 1 (portion), Block 77.01/Lot 1 (portion), Block 83/Lot 1 (portion); North Brunswick Township (Site 3) - Block 148/Lot 114.01 (portion) and (Site 4) - Block 262/Lot 108. The sewer service area additions are: 3.57 acres (Site 1), 14.23 acres (Site 2), 23.96 acres (Site 3) and 2.97 acres (Site 4). Sites 1-3 were reviewed prior to the adoption (on March 11, 2015) of the Middlesex County Future Wastewater Service Area (FWSA) map amendment but could not be included upon adoption because that would have constituted a substantive change to the amendment that was publicly noticed. All sites are currently vacant, with the exception of Site 4, which has one single family home on the property. 13) This amendment, submitted on behalf of the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), expands the sewer service area (SSA) of the Stony Brook Regional Sewerage Authority’s (SBRSA) River Road Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) by a net amount of 1.95 acres. This amendment adds 3.54 acres that were not in the previously adopted sewer service area and removes 1.59 acres from the previously adopted sewer service area for a net increase of 1.95 acres (not 2.36 to be removed and a net increase of 1.18 acres as stated in the October 29, 2015 preliminary notice which was published in the November 4, 2015 DEP Bulletin); the difference is due to a calculation error, the SSA being proposed has not changed. The SSA which has been removed reverts to the Individual Subsurface Sewage Disposal Systems of 2,000 gallons per day (gpd) or less (septic area) designation. The project site is located in Princeton, Mercer County on a portion of Block 11201/Lot 1 which is west of the intersection of Springdale Road and West Drive.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2016-02-09T00:00:00</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Matthew LaMarca</rpIndName><rpOrgName>NJDEP - Office of Water Resources Management Coordination</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum tddtty="">609-633-7053</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>401 East State Street</delPoint><city>Trenton</city><adminArea>NJ</adminArea><postCode>08625</postCode><eMailAdd>Matthew.LaMarca@dep.nj.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntInstr>via email</cntInstr></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="007"/></role></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>New amendments/ revisions adopted since the adoption of the mapping update on February 09, 2016 have been added into the mapping: 1) This amendment, proposing a new area wide WMP for Ocean County, was submitted by the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders 2) This amendment provides for a Town of Hackettstown municipal WMP that identifies wastewater service designations within the municipality. 3) Updated attributes to Greenwich Township to reflect correct information. 4) Revision, entitled “Old Stage Road Subdivision”, submitted on behalf of K.

The project site (Site) is located in Old Bridge Township west of U.S. Highway 9 and south of Water Works Road on portions of Lots 3.11, 6, and 7 within Block 6303. 2) Amendment, submitted on behalf of Federal Business Centers, Inc., expands the Middlesex County Utilities Authority (MCUA) sewage treatment plant (STP) sewer service area (SSA) by 9.6 acres to include portions of Block 2/Lot 1 and Block 3/Lot 32 in Monroe Township, southeast of the intersection of State Highway 33 and Butcher Road (County Route 619). The Disbrow Hills development is a proposed office/warehouse development of 308,000 square feet. 3) Amendment, This amendment provides for a Pohatcong Township municipal WNIP that identifies wastewater service designations within the municipality. The municipal WMP designates as Future Sewer Service Area, those areas within the municipality that are currently served, or are planned to be served in the future, by public wastewater treatment facilities or individual NJPDES permitted treatment facilities, and additionally, identifies areas as Septic Areas (those areas with Planning Flows of 2,000 Gallons per Day (GPI)) or less). All of the Sewer Service Area (SSA) identified in the municipal WMP is served by the Phillipsburg Sewer Treatment Plant (STP) (NJ0024716), a municipal facility that also provides wastewater treatment to Phillipsburg Town, Alpha Borough, Lopatcong Township and Greenwich Township, all within the Highlands Region, and having an approved and operative total permitted system capacity of 3.5 million gallons per day (MGD). 4) Revision, to the Northeast Water Quality Management Plan in Morris Plains Borough, Morris County (Program Interest No.: 435442; Activity No.: REV160001) was adopted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (Department).  This revision modifies the Department’s geographic information systems (GIS) representation of the New Jersey Statewide Sewer Service Area (SSA) mapping within the Borough of Morris Plains, Morris County to identify Block 41.02, Lot 39.04 and a small portion of Block 41.02, Lot 39, as SSA of the Butterworth Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).  The inclusion of the SSA to the Butterworth STP on the northeast portion of Block 41.02, Lot 39 will allow for the construction of a proposed future Morris Plains municipal park facility and return the SSA designation to Block 41.02, Lots 39.04, a 2.5 acre property with an existing single family dwelling currently connected and served by the Butterworth STP.</stepDesc><stepDateTm>2016-06-03T00:00:00</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Matthew LaMarca</rpIndName><rpOrgName>NJDEP - Office of Water Resources Management Coordination</rpOrgName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum tddtty="">609-633-7053</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType="both"><delPoint>401 East State Street</delPoint><city>Trenton</city><adminArea>NJ</adminArea><postCode>08625</postCode><eMailAdd>Matthew.LaMarca@dep.nj.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntInstr>via email</cntInstr></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="007"/></role></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep><stepDesc>New amendments/ revisions adopted since the adoption of the mapping update on June 3, 2016 have been added into the mapping: 1) Amendment,  Mercer County, This amendment, submitted on behalf of Raajpo LLC, allows for the construction of 115 age restricted three-bedroom single family homes and an on-site swimming pool with a clubhouse on an approximately 83 acre portion of Block 14, Lot 25 in Robbinsville Township.
