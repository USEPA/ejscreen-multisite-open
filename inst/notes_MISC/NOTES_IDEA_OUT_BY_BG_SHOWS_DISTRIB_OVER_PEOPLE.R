# EJAM should output one row per site but 
# also another table that is 
# one row per block group 
# where only unique blocks were counted.  
#
# That is how summarizer can show distribution across people more accurately 
# than by doing only 1 clump of people per site weighted by site for example,
# and you can show a histogram of people/pdf/cdf, etc.

# (you may not absolutely need blocks, just block groups, since you have no variations in 
#  demographics across blocks in one blockgroup, ??? or do you still get
# more useful detail if you know the variations in traffic across blocks in a bg
#  show up as steps since other blocks at similar levels in other bgs too)

# you can output the demog counts at each bg
# and the percentages at each bg
# to then show distribution of risk or even distances across these people 
# you would have 


# and then still have the overall stats done into one row as summary formulas
# based on 



# For distribution of distances (proximities) in each demog group, 
# What stat do we need to report exactly? 
#  Each bg has several blocks and each block may have 
# several distances to various specific sites.
#
# also EJAM should output distance of avg person in bg to the closest site?
#  need to figure that out carefully - each block has 0,1,or 2+ sites nearby
# but within a bg, different sites may be closest, etc.
