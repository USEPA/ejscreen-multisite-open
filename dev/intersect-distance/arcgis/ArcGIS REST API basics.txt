Example of one point:
{"x" : -118.15, "y" : 33.80, "spatialReference" : {"wkid" : 4326}}

Example of 4 points:
{
  "points" : [[-97.06138,32.837],[-97.06133,32.836],[-97.06124,32.834],[-97.06127,32.832]],
  "spatialReference" : {"wkid" : 4326}
}

Example of  a feature object (geometry plus attributes):
{
  "geometry" : {"x" : -118.15, "y" : 33.80},
